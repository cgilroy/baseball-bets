# baseball-bets: Baseball Betting Tool

[Check it out](http://cgilroy.github.io/baseball-bets)

This is a small project currently in progress I deployed for a friend of mine to use for sports betting.

It takes data from the MLB API and compares certain key matchup statistics (as indicated by my friend) to decide which games he should bet on.

## Skills Developed
* React.js - another create-react-app project
* Material-UI - tried my first React UI framework

## Known Issues
* The site is currently in development so it's formatting is a little buggy at the moment.

## Project Conclusions
The MLB API definitely seems related to the NHL API; I'd bet they use a similar statistics service.  The Promise chaining was complicated, but I am getting more and more confident with it.
